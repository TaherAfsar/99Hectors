<div class="py-lg-3 px-lg-3">
<p>It is a dream of many to own a comfortable home, here are some things a buyer needs to know before purchasing a house.
<br><br>
    Step 1: Budget:
    A proper budget has to be planned to know how much money will be left each month to meet your expenses. Remember that your first property will seldom be your final property, so search after your present property getting needs first, and let the long term take care of itself. You should guarantee that the property you are getting will satisfy your present needs and be within your budget. As a property buyer, understanding your family’s present major needs will help you make the right decision.
    <br><br>
    Step 2: Location:
    It is essential to choose Take a good look at the location and the locality. It is better to try a place adjacent to the prime location of your city so that the price is not that high. Location will also have a large impact on the resale value of your home. Choose wisely and your home may be your best investment.
    <br><br>
    Step 3: Rental rates in the area:
    If you are are planning about investing in a rental property, homes in high-rent or highly populated areas are ideal. Knowing the rental rate in the area helps you to choose the right property and location.
    <br><br>
    Step 4: Good Resale Value:
    Resale sale Value is an important thing to consider before you plan to invest or buy a property. Property buyers never consider resale value when they buy. They make the mistake of focusing solely on a prime locality or the budget of the property. If you choose the wrong property or location, it is possible that your future sales price will always be less than the other homes around it.
    <br><br>
    Step 5:Loan eligibility:
    Home loan eligibility depends upon the repayment capacity, income, existing loans or debts and age of the loan applicant. The lending company or banks provide online services such as home loan eligibility calculator to calculate loan eligibility of the home loan borrower. The maximum loan that can be sanctioned varies with the banks and the eligibility criteria may vary according to the bank or RBI regulations. As home loan rates increase, the loan eligibility for a borrower becomes stiffer.
    <br><br>
    Step 6:Stamp Duty & Registration Fee:
    This is an important expense or tax, much like the sales tax and income tax that are collected by the Government. When planning your budget for property buying and deciding to buy a property, you need to know the rate and charges applicable in your city. If you want to know the market value of your property and the stamp duty amount on it, you need to contact the Ready Reckoner to locate your valuation zone and sub-zone. Find out the stamp duty amount applicable to you as per the market value.
    <br><br>
    Step 7:Additional Costs:
    Even if this isn’t your first home buying experience, you will want to get help from a team of professionals. Fees or service charge by real estate agents, lenders or mortgage brokers,home inspector, land surveyor, lawyer or notary etc should be considered. Find out how much is the maintenance charge. Will car parking be provided and do you have to pay extra for it. If your previous owner did not have a vehicle, speak to the secretary of the society and ask for a parking lot.
    <br><br>
    Step 8:Property insurance:
    Property insurance safeguards your financial future if certain damages occur to your property. The cost is relatively low and provides coverage in case of problems with the property title, certain damages or any legal issue. There are many different home insurance policies to choose from, with varying levels of protection. When taking a decision to protect your major assets, it is important to have a resource you can trust, to guide you along the way. Choosing the right house insurance protects your property and makes the process of buying easy.</p>

   <b><strong>How Much Minimum Down Payment is Required for Home Loan?</strong></b> 
    <br>
    The fact that home loans have made life easy for millions of people in India is no understatement. It is a very affordable solution for anyone dreaming of owning a house or investing in a real estate property. Why? Because a home loan lets you pay the property cost in easy-to-manage EMIs. But do you get the entire property cost as a loan from your lender? The answer is no.
    
    This is where a home loan down payment comes in. It is the upfront cost that you as a home buyer pay for the purchase of the property, with the remaining property cost to be paid as home loan EMIs.
    
    In this blog, we will talk about what a down payment is, what is the minimum down payment for a home loan, tips to manage down payment and more.
    <br><br>
    <b>What is Home Loan Down Payment?</b>
    <br>
    Your home loan down payment has everything to do with your home loan eligibility.
    <br>
    
    Before sanctioning a home loan, your lender will thoroughly examine your home loan application and the pertaining documents. <b>The factors that a lender looks at are:</b> 
    <br><br>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Age of the applicant</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Income of the applicant</strong></li>
    <li><strong>The credit score of the applicant</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Existing loans of the applicant</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Occupation/nature of business of the applicant</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Income tax returns of the applicant</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Property value</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
    Depending on these factors, the lender will be able to tell you the maximum amount of housing loan you are eligible for. Ultimately, you will not get 100% property value in the form of a home loan. There is a certain percentage of the property cost that you have to pay upfront to the seller. This is called the down payment on house or ‘one’s own contribution’ to the property purchase.
    <br><br>
       
    <b>What is the Minimum Down Payment Required for Home Loan?</b>
    <br>
    As per RBI/NHB guidelines, banks and financial institutions can offer up to 90% LTV (loan to value), depending upon the property cost. 
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For property below 30 lakhs: maximum 90% LTV is allowed</strong></li>
        <li><strong>For property in the range of 30 to 75 lakhs:  maximum 80% LTV is allowed</strong></li>
        <li><strong>For property above 75 lakhs: maximum 75% LTV is allowed</strong></li>

        This means that the balance property cost to be paid by the home buyer as down payment in order to avail home loan.  
    </ul>
     
    <br>    
    <b>Benefits of Paying Minimum Down Payment for Home Loan</b>
    <br>
    Of course, paying a smaller down payment for a home loan sounds very reasonable and lucrative. <strong> Here are some of its benefits:</strong>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>It is more affordable.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>You will not have to eat up through your critical savings or investments to generate money for a down payment.<li><strong>
        <li><strong>you will be able to retain surplus liquid cash which you can invest in other high-yielding assets.</strong></li>
        However, the lesser your down payment, the more will be your home loan amount. This means you will be paying a higher interest amount for a longer duration.
    </ul>
    <br><br>    
     <b>Benefits of Paying a Bigger Down Payment for Home Loan</b><br>
    If you are able, then we recommend paying as much down payment on the house as financially possible. Of course, it should not come at the expense of your savings or risking your financial security. <strong>There are many benefits of doing so:</strong> 
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>our home loan amount will be reduced which ultimately reduces your overall liability.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>With a lower home loan amount, you will most likely get more favourable interest rates and lower EMI from your lender.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>You can pay off your home loan much quicker.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
   
     <b>conclusion</b>
     <br>
    There is no thumb rule as to the ideal home loan down payment that you should pay. It all depends on your financial capability. Of course, if you are able, paying a 30-40% down payment can make your home loan incredibly affordable in the long run! Hence, you should always consult with the lender on the best possible amount that you can pay as the down payment for ease of financial burden.
